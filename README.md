# CreativeProject2

This is a simple web app that will help build a Magic the Gathering deck using:

https://magicthegathering.io/

If you want to use it, and are unframiliar with the names of cards, try searching for Angel, plains, island, swamp, forest, or island.
This should give you some cards to expiriment with the website and see how it works.

The working version of this project is  <i>presently</i> hosted here:
